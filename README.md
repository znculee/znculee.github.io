# Personal Website

## Tutorial

We are using [Bundler](https://bundler.io) in comination with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to power Github pages.
Dependencies are stored in the `Gemfile` and are cached in the `Gemfile.lock`.

You can install the environment by running:
```shell
bundle install
```

If you want to run the website locally you can do so by using the following:
```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
