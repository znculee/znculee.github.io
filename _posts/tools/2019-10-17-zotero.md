# Knowledge Management

There are too much information currently in our life, and it is very important to manage our knowledge. We should know what we have seen and recall them quickly. I migrate from Mendeley because of its uncomfortable UI and experiences. Zotero is an open source software with very handy browser extensions.

# Plugins

## Recommendations

- [Better BibTex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases) generates bibtex as you want
- [Markdown Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/releases) renders the notes by pressing `<ctrl>+<option>+M`
- [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/) manages the attachments
  * [giorginolab/zotfile_doctor](https://github.com/giorginolab/zotfile_doctor) checks the consistency between Zotfile's file storage and the corresponding Zotero's view
- [ZoteroQuickLook](https://github.com/mronkko/ZoteroQuickLook/releases) implement the preview by pressing `<space>`
