# Multiple CUDA in the same system

Sometimes, we need different environments. Here shows a way to install the second coda in your current system. In my situation, cuda-8.0 was installed, so I'm not going to install the graphics driver again. You are recommend to install CUDA with `.run` file, because `.deb` could replace the graphics driver.

You may run the installer with the following command. `â€”tmpdir` solves the problem of `Not enough space on parition mounted at /.`

``` shell
sudo sh cuda_9.0.176_384.81_linux-run --tmpdir=<dir_with_enough_space>
```

You can select the options as follows.

``` shell
Do you accept the previously read EULA?      
accept/decline/quit: accept                  

Install NVIDIA Accelerated Graphics Driver for Linux-x86_64 384.81?

(y)es/(n)o/(q)uit: n                         

Install the CUDA 9.0 Toolkit?                
(y)es/(n)o/(q)uit: y                         

Enter Toolkit Location
 [ default is /usr/local/cuda-9.0 ]:         

Do you want to install a symbolic link at /usr/local/cuda?

(y)es/(n)o/(q)uit: n                         

Install the CUDA 9.0 Samples?                
(y)es/(n)o/(q)uit: n
```

After the CUDA is installed, You can set your environment as follows.

``` shell
sudo rm /usr/local/cuda
sudo ln -s /usr/local/cuda-9.0 /usr/local/cuda
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
```

Then, you can check your CUDA version by `nvcc --version`. Finally, install cuDNN as following commands.

``` shell
tar -zxvf cudnn-9.0-linux-x64-v7.1.tgz
sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include/
sudo cp cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64/ -d
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*
```
