## Configuration

- Global: [~/.gitconfig](https://github.com/znculee/dotfiles/blob/master/git/.gitconfig)
- Local: `/path/to/repo/.git/config`
  ```bash
  [user]
    name = <name>
    email = <email>
  [credential]
    helper = store
    username = <username>
  ```

## Basic Git Workflow

*Working Directory* => *Staging Area* => *Repository*

Creates a new Git repository.

```bash
git init
```

Inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area.

```bash
git status
```

Adds files from the working directory to the staging area.

```bash
git add <filename>
git add -A # add changes from all tracked and untracked files
```

Removes files from the working directory, and adds the removal to  the staging area.

```bash
git rm <filename>
git rm -r <dirname> # allow recursive removal
```

Renames file, and adds this change to staging area.

```bash
git mv <file-original> <file-renamed>
```

Shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area.

```bash
git diff <filename>
```

Permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository.

```bash
git commit -m "<message>"
git commit --amend -m "<message>" # amend previous commit
git commit --amend --no-edit # amend previous commit without changing message
git commit -a # commit all changed files
```

Shows a list of all previous commits in current branch.

```bash
git log
git log -<num> --oneline --decorate
git log -S "<keyword>" # search
git reflog # manage reflog information
```

### Backtrack in Git

Shows the infomation of specified commit. The `<commit>` may be `<first 7 characters of the commit_SHA>` or `HEAD`. The commit you are currently on is known as the `HEAD`.

```bash
git show <commit>
```

Discards changes in the working directory.

```bash
git checkout <filename> # restore from staging area to working directory
git checkout <commit> <filename> # restore from specified commit to working directory and staging area
git checkout <commit> # change HEAD to specified commit, along with working directory, staging area and repository, but do not change the head of any branch.
```

Can be used to reset to a previous commit in your commit history, and change the head of current branch. The default `<commit>` is `HEAD`.

```bash
git reset <commit> <filename> # restore file changes in the staging area from specified commit
git reset <commit> # reset HEAD to specified commit, and restore staging area, but not working directory
git reset --hard <commit> # reset HEAD to specified commit, and restore staging area and working directory
git reset --soft <commit> # reset HEAD to specified commit only
```

### Git Branching

Lists all a Git project's branches.

```bash
git branch # list all local branch
git branch -r # list all remote branch
git branch -a # list all local and remote branch
git branch -vv # show hash, subject, and upstream branch
```

Creates a new branch. Branch names can’t contain whitespaces.

```bash
git branch <new_branch> # creat <new branch> and stay in current branch
git checkout -b <new_branch> # creat and switch to <new branch>
git switch -c <new_branch> # creat and switch to <new branch>
```

Used to switch from one branch to another.

```bash
git checkout <branch_name> # switch to <branch_name>
git switch <branch_name> # switch to <branch_name>
git checkout - # switch to previous branch
```

Used to join changes from specified branch to current one.

```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

Deletes the branch specified.

```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

### Git Teamwork

Creates a local copy of a remote.

```bash
git clone <url> <local_name>
```

Lists a Git project's remotes.

```bash
git remote -v
```

Fetches work from the remote into the local copy.

```bash
git fetch
git fetch -p origin
git fetch -p upstream
```

Merges `origin/master` into your local branch.

```bash
git merge origin/master
```

Pushes a local branch to the `origin` remote.

```bash
git push -u origin <branch_name>
git push upstream <branch_name>
```

```bash
git push origin +<branch_name>
git push -f origin <branch_name>
git push -f
```

Synchronize fork.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git rebase upstream/master
git push origin master
```

Get remote branch.

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name> origin/<branch_name>
```

## Fork-Branch-Pull Workflow

- Fork a GitHub repository
- Clone the repository locally
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
  ```
- Add remote called "upstream" pointing to the original repository
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/username/repo.git
  ```
- Checkout a new branch (here called "new-feature")
  ```bash
  git checkout -b new-feature
  ```
- Make desired changes to the local repository on this branch
- Pull new changes from remote
  ```bash
  git checkout master
  git pull -p upstream master
  ```
- Sync dev branch
  ```bash
  git checkout new-feature
  git merge master
  ```
- Push changes to your remote repository
  ```bash
  git push -u origin new-feature
  ```
- Open a pull request on GitHub merging your changes with the upstream (original) repository
- Once the pull request is accepted, you’ll want to pull those changes into your origin (forked repository).
  ```bash
  git checkout master
  git pull upstream master
  ```
- Delete your feature branch locally and remotely
  ```bash
  git branch -d new-feature
  git push -d origin new-feature
  ```

### Check out a GitHub pull request

```bash
git fetch <remote> pull/<id>/head:<branchname>
git checkout <branchname>
```
where `<remote>` might be `origin` or `upstream`,
`<id>` is the pull request id,
and `<branchname>` is the name of the new branch that you want to create, such as `pr-<id>`.
The head of pull request may be behind the main or dev branch, so you may want to merge the main or dev branch to this pr branch first before testing.

### Clean branches from forked repo

The `upstream` branches may be updated, so it may not be necessary to keep unused branch in `origin`.
If you are going to working on `upstream/<branch_name>`, you may `git switch -c <branch_name> upstream/<branch_name>`.
Then, `git push -u origin <branch_name>` to have the branch again in your own `origin`.
Regard the following command a reference only, and modify it for your own situation.
To excute, remove the dry option `-n` of `git push`.

```bash
git branch -r | grep origin/ | grep -v master | sed "s/^ *origin\///" | xargs git push -dn origin
```

## Other Topics

### Rewriting History

```bash
git rebase -i <commit>
git rebase -i HEAD~<num>
git rebase -i --root
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# d, drop = remove commit
```

### Force Overwrite Local Files

```bash
git featch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
git reset --hard origin/HEAD
git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>
```

### Ignore Tracked Files

```bash
git rm -r --cached <filename>
```

### Git Signed Commit

Firstly install `gpg` by `brew install gpg`. Then after following [Managing commit signature verification](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-commit-signature-verification), one may encounter `error: gpg failed to sign the data`. To solve this problem,
- bash: add `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` to `~/.bash_profile`.
- fish: add `set -x GPG_TTY (tty)` to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.

### Archive a Branch

To archive and delete the branch:

```bash
# Note that `archive/<archivename>` here is just a `<tag_name>`.
git tag archive/<archivename> <branchname>
git branch -d <branchname>
git push origin archive/<archivename>
git push origin --delete <branchname>
```

To restore the branch some time later:

```bash
git checkout -b <branchname> archive/<archivename>
```

### Multiple Github Accounts

- Generate a ssh key `ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_<username>`
- Add `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa_<username>.pub` to [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)
- Clone repo `git clone git@github.com:<username>/<reponame>.git`
- Add personal confidential to `.git/config` in a specific repo to overwrite the global configurations
  ```bash
  [core]
  ...
  sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_<username>
  [user]
    name = <name>
    email = <email>
  [credential]
    helper = store
    username = <username>
  ```
- Swich ssh key for `git clone` by changing `IdentityFile` in `~/.ssh/config`.
  If there's another key was added to the agent, you may execute `ssh-add -D` to clear it.
  ```
  Host *
      AddKeysToAgent no
      UseKeychain no
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      ForwardAgent yes
  ```
